# AGENTS.md — Night Post Master Context
*Single source of truth for every AI agent working in this vault. Load this file first in every session. Updated: 2026-10-09.*

`CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `.cursorrules`, and `.windsurfrules` are short pointers to this file that hold only tool-specific notes. Project content goes here, never in a pointer file.

Each protocol below is a short checklist. Its canonical page in `vault-guide/` holds the full rules; if the two differ, the page wins and this file gets corrected.

## Last Session Checkpoint

On 2026-10-09, sessions closed the Festival Demo phase, started Production in [[prototype/implementation-plan]], put the foldable-map PDR under Decisions Owed while it is drafted in chat, and left [[drafts/2026-10-09-resume-localization-vendors]] for the unfinished vendor comparison. The open question for Ines is whether 23 map requests justify a map that could undercut the moon-shift design in [[decisions/product/PDR-P004-moon-shifting-paths|PDR-P004]].

Full log: [[session-history]].

---

## Session Start Protocol

Run these steps at the start of every session, and again if you realize mid-session that you skipped them. Agents with skills run them as the `vault-start` skill; every step is a tool call, not a memory of a past session.

1. **Read this file in full**, then your tool's pointer file if it adds notes.
2. **Find what changed since the last session.** Take the date of the last `## YYYY-MM-DD` heading in [[session-history]] (`grep '^## ' session-history.md | tail -1`), then list files changed since that date:
   - **Git:** `git diff --name-status $(git log -1 --before="YYYY-MM-DD 00:00" --format=%H)`. The `00:00` makes the cutoff the start of that day, so the last session's own changes show up.
   - **No git:** `find . -type f -newermt "YYYY-MM-DD" ! -path "*/.git/*" ! -path "*/.obsidian/*"`
   - **No shell:** search for the date prefix over MCP, or ask the user what changed.
   - Flag root-level files, new decision records, new files in `drafts/`, and any hand-over note named `YYYY-MM-DD-resume-<topic>.md`.
3. **Ask the session type**: writing, design, art, build, research, decision, production, or vault maintenance.
4. **Load the files listed for that type** under Task-Specific Context Loading.
5. **Confirm readiness** in a few sentences: what changed, what you loaded, and anything odd about the vault's state.

At the end of any session that changed the vault, run the Post-Task Completion Gate.

## Hard Constraints — Never Violate Without an ADR

- **`journal/` is human-only.** Never write to `journal/`. It is Ines's personal record.
- **Terse by default.** Vault documents follow the Writing Discipline section below. A document that fails the tightening checklist is not done.
- **Wikilink discipline.** When editing a vault document, link each reference to its canonical vault location with a `[[wikilink]]` ([[vault-guide/wikilink-discipline]]).
- **The ledger is the AI's; the task list is the human's.** AI sessions route new action items to `prototype/implementation-plan.md`. Ines curates `prototype/human-task-list.md`; AI never writes to it.
- **No orphan checkboxes.** Task checkboxes (`- [ ]`) appear only in the two task files and in protocol checklists, never as standalone lists elsewhere.
- **Decisions are reviewed before they are written.** Draft an ADR or PDR in chat, expect two to four rounds, and write the file only after Ines approves ([[vault-guide/decision-propagation-protocol]]).
- **Drafts ingestion gate.** AI-generated content lands in `drafts/` first and moves into the vault only after passing the promotion checklist ([[vault-guide/ingestion-gate]]).
- **No cruft.** When admitting AI content, fix or remove what's wrong instead of flagging it. Keep the untouched original as `_source-<name>.md` beside the clean doc.
- **Append-only logs.** Add to `session-history.md` and the weekly log by appending, never by rewriting ([[vault-guide/session-logs]]).
- **Stay in phase.** Don't build features outside the current phase.
- **`world/` is settled canon.** AI-written lore lands in `drafts/` and enters `world/` only after Ines reviews it against canon. If a script, letter, or design doc contradicts `world/`, `world/` wins until Ines changes it ([[world/README]]).

Night Post's product and stack invariants live in [[architecture/CONSTITUTION]]. In short: no death or fail state from encounters, every letter readable at handheld size, offline and single-player with no microtransactions, scope that fits three people and an October 2027 launch, Godot 4 and GDScript only, 30 frames per second at 800p on the handheld floor, and all text in plain-text files under version control.

---

## Session Interaction Style

- **Suggest freely.** Share useful advice, risks, and alternatives even when not asked, kept short and separate from the main task. Skip filler, apologies, and narration of tool use.
- **Research may widen; decisions wait.** When one source leads to another, follow it. Capture framing in concept notes and drafts, and send decision candidates to the ledger instead of drafting them mid-research.

---

## Writing Discipline

Write for Ines first and the next AI session second, following the four principles of ISO 24495-1 plain language: readers get what they need, find it easily, understand it, and can act on it. The full rules are in [[vault-guide/style-guides/ai-writing-discipline-core]]; research docs follow [[vault-guide/style-guides/research-paper-discipline]].

**Tightening Checklist.** Every document an AI agent writes or substantially edits must pass this checklist before the task is complete.
1. The first sentence states the core claim (BLUF).
2. No paragraph exceeds 2 sentences (research docs may use single-thought paragraphs).
3. No narrative preamble before a self-explanatory table or list.
4. No stacked near-synonymous adjectives.
5. No meta-commentary in the body ("This section covers...").
6. ADRs and PDRs contain no implementation specs or multi-line code blocks.
7. Biographies run 2 lines or fewer; executive summaries 12 lines or fewer.
8. No reified observations (abstract differences named, capitalized, or declared as principles).
9. No sentence fragments. Every sentence has a subject and a verb.
10. No more than one em-dash per paragraph.

## What Night Post Is

Night Post is a narrative adventure RPG for PC and handheld PCs. The player is Wren, the newest courier of the Night Post, delivering letters after dark through Hollowmere, a forest whose paths rearrange with the phase of the moon; every quest is a letter, and Wren may open sealed ones ([[architecture/game-design-overview]], [[world/hollowmere]]).

The team is three people, self-funded: Ines Okafor (writer, narrative designer, project lead, and vault owner), Tomas Varga (programmer and composer), and Priya Lund (artist and UI designer). The goal is an 8 to 10 hour game at $18, launching in October 2027 in English, Spanish, and German, as set out in [[strategy/goals-and-audience]] and [[strategy/release-plan]].

---

## Current Phase

Phase 5, Production, started 2026-10-07 after the online demo festival (2026-09-29 to 2026-10-05). The first milestone is final art, script, and music for [[world/regions/thimble-cross]] by 2027-01-29; in the meantime the team must resolve [[ideas/foldable-map]], choose a localization vendor, and submit the Northern Arts Fund application by 2026-11-30 ([[strategy/funding]]).

---

## Vault Structure

Every top-level folder has a `README.md` listing its files. Folders named `archive/` hold retired docs and are exempt from tightening and scans.

- **`architecture/`**: `CONSTITUTION.md` (hard constraints), the game design overview, system docs in `systems/`, and interface docs in `ui/`.
- **`decisions/`**
  - `technical/`: ADRs for tools, stack, and system design.
  - `product/`: PDRs for product, business, and creative choices.
  - `rejected/`: decisions considered and declined. Never revive one without a new record.
  - `_BASES_SCHEMA.md`: frontmatter schema, status meanings, tags, and search recipes.
- **`strategy/`**: goals, audience, positioning, release plan, and funding.
- **`concepts/`**: definitions of key terms. A concept note says *what something is*.
- **`ideas/`**: raw proposals awaiting evaluation. Each has a `resolved-by` field.
- **`world/`**: settled canon for Hollowmere: regions (with cut regions under `regions/cut/`), factions, characters, and the timeline. AI lore drafts wait in `drafts/` until Ines approves them.
- **`research/`**: evidence, such as playtests, surveys, tests, market data, and source summaries.
- **`prototype/`**: game code lives in a separate Godot repository.
  - `implementation-plan.md`: the AI ledger and production plan.
  - `human-task-list.md`: Ines's working list. AI never writes here.
  - `implementation-logs/`: weekly append-only logs (`YYYY-Www.md`), kept since 2026-07-06.
  - `specs/`: milestone specs.
- **`drafts/`**: staging area for AI-generated content and hand-over notes (`YYYY-MM-DD-resume-<topic>.md`).
- **`prompts/`**: reusable prompts, including research briefs.
- **`vault-guide/`**: canonical protocol pages and style guides.
- **`journal/`**: human-only notes. Read-only for AI.
- **`session-history.md`**: one line per session, append-only.
- **`.link-check-ignore`**: intentional links to notes that don't exist yet.

---

## Tools & Stack

| Area | Tool |
|---|---|
| Engine | Godot 4 with GDScript ([[decisions/technical/ADR-T001-godot-4-engine]]) |
| Script and letters | Plain-text script files loaded by an in-house parser ([[decisions/technical/ADR-T003-plain-text-dialogue-files]]) |
| Art | Krita for painted 2D backgrounds and characters |
| Music and sound | Reaper, plus field recordings from [[research/audio/field-recording-trip]] |
| Version control | Git, with Git LFS (large file storage) for art and audio |
| Test hardware | One handheld PC at the 800p floor ([[concepts/handheld-floor]]) |

**Common commands** (run from the game repository): `godot --path game/` opens the project; `godot --headless --path game/ --script tools/word_count.gd` reports words per letter against the 120-word [[concepts/letter-budget]].

**Vault scripts** (Python 3, in `.claude/skills/`; each page in `vault-guide/` gives a manual fallback):
- `vault-links/vault-link-check.py`: finds broken wikilinks.
- `vault-maintenance/vault-lint.py`: checks session logs and file size at session close.
- `vault-maintenance/vault-review-scan.py`: flags writing-discipline and reweave gaps.

---

## Agentic Boundaries

- **Always:** Apply the tightening checklist to any vault document you write or edit. Use `[[wikilinks]]`.
- **Ask first:** Any change to `world/` canon, new Godot add-ons or plugins, anything that spends money (vendors, contractors, ads), store page copy, and changes to price, launch date, or launch languages.
- **Never:** Commit secrets, edit `.env` files, write to `journal/` or `human-task-list.md`, write a decision record before Ines approves it, or change a standing decision without a new record.

---

## Vault Access Tools

Use the best tool your environment offers:

1. **Filesystem tools** (read, grep, glob, edit): the default for CLI agents.
2. **Obsidian CLI**, if installed: `search`, `backlinks`, `orphans`, `unresolved`, `move`.
3. **Obsidian MCP** (desktop apps): read, search, create, append, move.
4. **Copy and paste** (web chat): the user pastes files in and copies your output back.

Move or rename notes with a tool that rewrites links (Obsidian `move` or MCP move). Plain `mv` leaves every link pointing at the old path.

---

## Task-Specific Context Loading

- **Writing (letters, dialogue, lore):** the `world/` docs for the region and characters involved, [[concepts/letter-budget]], [[concepts/sealed-letter]], and [[decisions/product/PDR-P008-sealed-letters-can-be-opened|PDR-P008]]. New lore goes to `drafts/`, not `world/`.
- **Design (systems and levels):** [[architecture/game-design-overview]], the relevant doc in `architecture/systems/`, the matching `concepts/` notes, and the constitution's clauses P1 and P4.
- **Art (backgrounds, characters, interface):** [[decisions/product/PDR-P005-painted-night-palette|PDR-P005]], [[research/accessibility/night-palette-colorblind-test]], [[architecture/ui/letter-reader]], and [[decisions/product/PDR-P011-readable-letters|PDR-P011]].
- **Build (code, tools, performance):** [[decisions/technical/ADR-T001-godot-4-engine|ADR-T001]], [[decisions/technical/ADR-T002-handheld-performance-floor|ADR-T002]], [[decisions/technical/ADR-T003-plain-text-dialogue-files|ADR-T003]], [[decisions/technical/ADR-T005-atomic-saves|ADR-T005]], Part II of the constitution, and the current plan phase.
- **Research (playtests, surveys, audits):** `research/`, the decisions it may affect, and [[vault-guide/research-paper-workflow]]. Playtests most often bear on [[decisions/product/PDR-P004-moon-shifting-paths|PDR-P004]] and [[decisions/product/PDR-P011-readable-letters|PDR-P011]]; market data on [[decisions/product/PDR-P010-price-18-dollars|PDR-P010]]. Write up playtests with [[prompts/playtest-synthesis]].
- **Decision:** [[decisions/README]] and `architecture/CONSTITUTION.md`. Check for an existing or rejected decision before proposing a new one.
- **Production (planning, strategy, funding):** [[prototype/implementation-plan]], the `strategy/` docs, [[research/production/scope-and-burn]], and the current spec in `prototype/specs/`.
- **Vault maintenance:** [[vault-guide/vault-design-philosophy]], the style guide, the relevant `vault-guide/` page, the README of any folder you change, [[session-history]], and the `drafts/` folder.
- **Anything else:** [[vault-guide/vault-design-philosophy]] and the README of the most relevant folder.

---

## Standing Decisions (Do Not Relitigate Without a New Decision Record)

- **Core fantasy:** every quest is a letter carried by a night courier ([[decisions/product/PDR-P001-letters-are-the-quests|PDR-P001]]).
- **Engine:** Godot 4 with GDScript ([[decisions/technical/ADR-T001-godot-4-engine|ADR-T001]]).
- **Performance floor:** a handheld PC at 30 frames per second and 800p ([[decisions/technical/ADR-T002-handheld-performance-floor|ADR-T002]]).
- **Text format:** dialogue and letters in plain-text files the writer edits directly ([[decisions/technical/ADR-T003-plain-text-dialogue-files|ADR-T003]]).
- **Saves:** write to a temp file, then rename ([[decisions/technical/ADR-T005-atomic-saves|ADR-T005]]).
- **Music:** layers that thin out on long walks and return at arrivals ([[decisions/technical/ADR-T006-adaptive-music-layers|ADR-T006]]).
- **Moon-shifting paths:** paths rearrange by moon phase ([[decisions/product/PDR-P004-moon-shifting-paths|PDR-P004]]). Playtest 4 weakened this on 2026-08-18, and fixed waymark landmarks answered it.
- **Art:** painted 2D in a limited night palette ([[decisions/product/PDR-P005-painted-night-palette|PDR-P005]]). The colorblind test weakened this on 2026-07-27, so route lanterns also differ in shape.
- **Sealed letters:** players may open them, with social consequences only ([[decisions/product/PDR-P008-sealed-letters-can-be-opened|PDR-P008]]).
- **Encounters:** parley, with no health and no death ([[decisions/product/PDR-P009-parley-encounters|PDR-P009]], which superseded [[decisions/product/PDR-P003-turn-based-encounters|PDR-P003]]).
- **Price:** $18 at launch ([[decisions/product/PDR-P010-price-18-dollars|PDR-P010]]).
- **Letters on screen:** handwriting for headers and signatures only, a readable body typeface, and a font toggle ([[decisions/product/PDR-P011-readable-letters|PDR-P011]], which superseded [[decisions/product/PDR-P006-handwritten-letters|PDR-P006]]).
- **Regions:** three, with the Drowned Bell and the High Briar cut ([[decisions/product/PDR-P012-three-regions|PDR-P012]], which superseded [[decisions/product/PDR-P002-five-regions|PDR-P002]]).
- **Languages:** English, Spanish, and German at launch ([[decisions/product/PDR-P014-launch-languages|PDR-P014]]).

**Rejected, do not revive without a new record:**
- **Procedural forest generation:** hand-placed letters and landmarks need authored paths ([[decisions/rejected/ADR-T004-procedural-forest|ADR-T004]]).
- **Online co-op:** networking cost, the solitary tone, and clause P3 ([[decisions/rejected/PDR-P007-co-op-courier-mode|PDR-P007]]).
- **Full voice acting:** cost per word and localization; voiced barks only ([[decisions/rejected/PDR-P013-full-voice-acting|PDR-P013]]).

---

## Decision Records

Check `decisions/technical/`, `decisions/product/`, and `decisions/rejected/` before proposing any change, and search frontmatter instead of reading every file (`grep -rl "status: rejected" decisions/`). The schema, status meanings, and tag list are in [[decisions/_BASES_SCHEMA]].

---

## Decision Propagation Protocol

**Trigger:** Any new decision (ADR, PDR, tool adoption, change in direction). Canonical page: [[vault-guide/decision-propagation-protocol]].
**Rule:** The task isn't complete until every item is done or marked N/A.

- [ ] List three alternatives with one-line tradeoffs, draft the record in chat, and write it only after Ines approves.
- [ ] Update `prototype/implementation-plan.md`.
- [ ] Update `architecture/CONSTITUTION.md` if the decision touches a hard constraint.
- [ ] Mark any superseded record `superseded-by` and link the new one. An amended record stays `accepted`.
- [ ] Update this file if the decision changes Standing Decisions, Vault Structure, or Task-Specific Context Loading.
- [ ] Log the decision in this week's implementation log.

---

## Reweave Protocol

**Trigger:** New information arrives (playtests, surveys, festival or store data, a change in direction). Canonical page: [[vault-guide/reweave-protocol]].
**Rule:** The task isn't complete until every item is done.

- [ ] **Find affected docs.** Ask of each decision, strategy, or design doc: *"If this were written today, would its conclusions change?"*
- [ ] **Classify the impact:** strengthened (add a link), weakened (write a dated note into the affected doc and flag Ines), or invalidated (never change it silently; flag Ines and propose a superseding record).
- [ ] **Add `## Reweave Triggers`** to the new document, listing affected files with `[[wikilinks]]` and one-line impacts. If nothing is affected, write `No existing docs affected.`
- [ ] **Backfill on touch.** A research doc you read in full or edit that lacks `## Reweave Triggers` gets one before the task closes.
- [ ] **Route action items** to the implementation plan and log the reweave in this week's implementation log.

---

## Post-Task Completion Gate

Before marking any substantive task complete:

| Did the task… | Then… |
|---|---|
| Produce a new research doc? | Run the Reweave Protocol. |
| Read a primary source? | Make sure the source has its own doc in `research/`, not only an interpretation. |
| Touch a research doc with no `## Reweave Triggers`? | Add the section (backfill on touch). |
| Touch a decision record? | Add citation links for any claims you can verify. |
| Make a decision? | Run the Decision Propagation Protocol. |
| Generate action items? | Route them to `prototype/implementation-plan.md`, never `human-task-list.md`. |
| Change Hard Constraints, Standing Decisions, or Vault Structure? | Update this file. |
| Write or edit any vault doc? | Run the tightening checklist. |
| Create or edit `[[wikilinks]]`? | Run `vault-link-check.py` on the affected files. Fix each broken target, link the nearest real note, or add an intended forward link to `.link-check-ignore`. |
| Add a script or config to a skill folder? | Document it in that skill's `SKILL.md`. |
| Change the vault at all? | Append a section to this week's `prototype/implementation-logs/YYYY-Www.md` and one line under today's `## YYYY-MM-DD` heading in [[session-history]], each with a single append. Update Last Session Checkpoint above, then run `vault-lint.py`. |

If no row applies, no integration pass is needed.

---

## Research Traceability

Every empirical claim in a decision, strategy, or design doc links to the vault research doc that supports it: `claim text ([[research/source-doc]] [maturity-tag])`. Canonical page: [[vault-guide/research-traceability]].

- **Unsourced claims** are flagged `[unsourced]`. Never write a research doc from memory; it must come from actual source material.
- **Findings vs. inferences:** a finding gets a plain link; an inference says so.
- **Primary over secondary:** link the primary source's doc when it exists; mark secondary-only citations.
- **Maturity tags:** `[established]`, `[supported]`, `[emerging]`, `[theoretical]`, also in the research doc's frontmatter as `evidence-maturity`. AI syntheses are tagged `secondary`.

---

## Vault Maintenance

- **Plan triage** when the ledger passes about 200 open items, after a major change in direction, or quarterly ([[vault-guide/implementation-plan-triage]]).
- **Vault review** quarterly or after a long gap ([[vault-guide/vault-review-protocol]]). Findings go to the ledger's Vault Maintenance section, never to a standalone report. The last review ran on 2026-10-08.

---

## Operational Gotchas

- **Auto-commit hides edits from `git status`.** If the Git plugin commits on a schedule, confirm an edit landed with `git log --oneline -3`.
- **Stray daily notes.** Obsidian sometimes creates `YYYY-MM-DD.md` at the vault root. Empty ones can be deleted; never touch `journal/`.
- **Broken links stay at zero.** Once `vault-link-check.py` reports zero, any new result is a regression to fix in the same session.
- **Large MCP writes can hang.** Write a short stub, then append in chunks of about 10KB.
- **Search lags new files.** Read files created this session by path instead of searching for them.
- **Truncated reads.** Some tools cut off long files. Never build an edit from text you didn't see in full, and keep this file under about 40KB.
- **Skills live outside Obsidian.** `.claude/skills/` isn't indexed by Obsidian, so scripts run only from a terminal-capable agent.
- **The published site needs titles.** This vault is published as a website, so every note except this file and [[session-history]] keeps a `title:` in frontmatter equal to its H1.

---

## Session History

The full history is in [[session-history]], one line per session under its date, oldest first, and weekly detail is in `prototype/implementation-logs/`. Both are append-only; don't add session entries to this file.
